# Mondrian CSS Challenge

During the early phases of [coding bootcamp](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/), we were asked to recreate the famous 
Mondrian artwork using only [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). It was just like working on a puzzle, it was super fun! I believe I was 
the first one to figure out the secret, divs and more divs with pseudo outlines. I also played around with using
percentages instead of fexed widths and reusing sections by flipping them around (reverse order).

## Cracking the code
Here's where I realized that I can dissect the artwork into columns and apply simple proportions/ratios to the various sections from a 1 to 10 scale.

CSS is all about debugging! At this point I was between using fixed pixels and percentages.

Instead of building each section from scratch, I just recylced and flipped the existing columns.

Success! I added little debugging markers for my own sanity.
