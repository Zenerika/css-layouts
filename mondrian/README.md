# Mondrian CSS Challenge

During the early phases of [coding bootcamp](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/), we were asked to recreate the famous 
Mondrian artwork using only CSS Flexbox. It was just like working on a puzzle, it was super fun! I believe I was 
the first one to figure out the secret, divs and more divs with pseudo outlines. I also played around with using
percentages instead of fexed widths and reusing sections by flipping them around (reverse order).

## Cracking the code
I created a flowchart to understand the project scope and then I continued creating updated to-do lists while prioritizing my //todos.
